# What is SQL

- stands for Structured Query Language
- SQL is the language we use to "talk" to our DB

## Examples:

- Final all users
- Find all users who are 18 years old
- Add a new user with username "asdf"
- Delete Every single user

```sql
 SELECT * FROM Users WHERE Age >=18;
```

# Working with MySQL is primarily writing SQL

## Hence, different databases use SQL

=> SQL is thus a standard language shared among different DBMSs.

## Relational database

- use tables

## Takeaways

- Once you learn SQL, its pretty easy to switch to another DB that uses SQL
- What makes each Databses (DBMS) unique, are the features they offer, not the language
