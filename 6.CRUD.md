# Create

```sql
 INSERT INTO yourtable (username, content, favorites)
VALUES ('john123', 'This is a tweet!', 10),
       ('mary456', 'Another tweet!', 5),
       ('jane789', 'Yet another tweet!', 2);

```

# Read

```sql
 SELECT * FROM mytable
 SELECT <column_name> FROM mytable
 SELECT <column_name1, column_name2> FROM mytable
```

# Read (where)

```sql
select * from mytable where age >3
select <col_name> from mytable where text ="text"
select * from mytable where <col_name> = <col_name>
```

# Read (alias)

```sql
select col_name as myName <constraints>
```

# Update (update all)

```sql
 UPDATE <tablename> SET col_name = "changeAll";
 UPDATE <tablename> SET col_name1 = "changeAll", col_name2 = "changeAll",
```

# Update (where)

```sql
UPDATE <tablename> SET col_name = "changeAll", col_name1 = "change",
WHERE col_name = 3
```

# Rule of thumb

- before updating or delete, use select + where to see if duplicates exist
